2024-07-19:

* bumped version to 1.2.7a1
* added t-SNE to decomposition/visualization method
* added an extra parameter method_params in calling plot_opu_abundance_biplot()
* added figure size and perplexity argument to opu_analysis script
* fixed some sample points landing outside of biplot figure
* improved spectra name deducing when loading dataset from a list of files
* fixed double plot when using Jupyter

2024-03-12:

* bumped version to 1.2.6

2024-02-07:

* fixed bug dpi not correctly used by Figure.savefig; savefig() overwrites dpi settings to rcParam["figure.dpi"] when not used; however, when called figure.set_dpi() in prior then calling figure.savefig(..., dpi="figure") also fails, the latter one seems to be a matplotlib issue. See: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/24644, https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/26252.

2024-02-05:

* added head/tail command to opu_dataset_manip
* refined SpectraDataset.get_sub_dataset logic
* fixed bug referencing old modules in top-level package
* fixed package find bug

2024-02-01:

* fixed a bug testing if first column is spectra names.
* simplified spectra name deduction logic in class SpectraDataset

2024-01-31:

* bumped version to 1.2.6rc2.
* added opu_dataset_manip script.
* fixed bug in wavenum compatibility testing with different array lengths.
* merged opu_transform_labspec into opu_dataset_manip.
* merged opu_spectra_preview into opu_dataset_manip.

2024-01-30:

* bumped version to 1.2.6rc1.
* fixed a bug testing if first column is spectra names.
* added functionality to open matplotlib interactive window when run opu_spectra_preview script in overview mode; could be handy in quick inspections. this functionality works on overview mode only.
* added --with-spectra-names be passed to opu_spectra_preview script.
* added auto-resolving of spectra name collision during SpectraDataset.concatenate() by trying to add the spectra dataset name as prefix; will raise an error if there are still name collisions thereafter.

2023-11-13:

* fixed spectra name collision in multiple datafiles when those datafiles are used in the same file list.
